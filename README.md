Consider a game board consisting of 6x7 cells, each of which can contain a piece of stone, and a set of colored (red and blue) stones. The first player plays with the red stones, the other with the blue stones. The board is initially empty. Players move in turn. In a move, a player must choose an empty cell and put a stone of his or her color into it. The game is over when a row, a column, or a diagonal contains 3 stones of the same color.

When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.
